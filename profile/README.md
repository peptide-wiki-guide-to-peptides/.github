## What Are Peptides?

Peptides are short chains of amino acids—typically 2 to 50—linked by peptide bonds. They’re smaller than proteins (which exceed 50 amino acids) but pack a mighty punch in biological systems. Acting as hormones, neurotransmitters, or signaling molecules, peptides are essential to life. They can be naturally occurring or lab-made for research, medicine, or skincare.

Why should you care? Peptides are behind processes like muscle growth, immune defense, and even mood regulation. Want to learn more about their building blocks? Check out [peptidewiki.net](https://peptidewiki.net/) for a detailed breakdown in its **peptide wiki**.

## Types of Peptides

Peptides come in various forms, each with unique roles. Here’s a quick rundown:

- **Bioactive Peptides**: These powerhouses fight infections or regulate bodily functions. Think antimicrobial peptides that zap bacteria.
- **Peptide Hormones**: Insulin and oxytocin are stars here, controlling blood sugar and bonding, respectively.
- **Synthetic Peptides**: Lab-crafted for precision, these are used in drugs or studies.
- **Neuropeptides**: Endorphins and substance P tweak your brain, easing pain or signaling stress.

## Functions of Peptides

Peptides wear many hats in the body. Here’s how they shine:

- **Signaling**: Growth factors tell cells to grow or heal—vital for recovery.
- **Immunity**: Antimicrobial peptides like defensins tackle pathogens fast.
- **Hormones**: Ghrelin triggers hunger, while insulin balances sugar levels.
- **Brain Power**: Neuropeptides like enkephalins lift your mood or dull pain.

Their versatility is mind-blowing, and new functions are discovered all the time. For the latest peptide roles, explore [peptidewiki.net](https://peptidewiki.net/)—it’s your go-to **peptide wiki** for updates.

## Applications of Peptides

Peptides aren’t just science trivia—they’re game-changers across industries:

- **Medicine**: Peptide drugs like liraglutide treat diabetes, while others target cancer or brain disorders. 
- **Cosmetics**: Anti-aging peptides (e.g., palmitoyl pentapeptide-4) boost collagen for youthful skin.
- **Research**: Scientists use peptides to probe protein behavior or test new theories.
- **Biotech**: Peptide vaccines offer safe, effective immunity boosts.

The possibilities keep growing, and [peptidewiki.net](https://peptidewiki.net/) keeps you in the loop. Visit the site’s **peptide guide** to see how peptides are shaping the future.

## Peptide Synthesis

Ever wonder how peptides are made? **Solid-phase peptide synthesis (SPPS)** is the gold standard. Here’s the gist:

1. Anchor an amino acid to a resin bead.
2. Add more amino acids, linking them into a chain.
3. Release and purify the finished peptide.

This method, pioneered by Bruce Merrifield, powers everything from drug labs to research benches. Want the nitty-gritty on synthesis? Head to [peptidewiki.net](https://peptidewiki.net/)—its **peptide wiki** has you covered.
